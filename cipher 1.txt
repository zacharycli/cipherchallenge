Well done on the first cipher. It was a polybius cipher, but you know that already.
In this repo there are two further ciphers. cipher 2 is a clue for cipher 3.
To break cipher 2, you need setting 6. Version 3 is ineffective.
To break cipher 3, follow the instructions in cipher 2.
You have all of the tools you need in this repo. Some of them may need some modification.
You will have to write the code described in cipher 2 yourself, but it only requires a single line.
Good luck.
